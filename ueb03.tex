Gegeben sei der folgende Java--Ausdruck:
\begin{center}
\code{a || b \&\& c}
\end{center}
Dabei seien \code{a, b, c} Variablen vom Typ \code{boolean}.
\medskip

Wie wird dieser Ausdruck abgearbeitet (engl. \emph{operator precedence})?
\begin{itemize}
  \item [a)] \code{(a || b) \&\& c}
  \item[b)] \code{a || b( \&\& c)}
\end{itemize}

Welche der folgenden Ausdrücke ist die korrekte \textbf{Negation}?
\begin{itemize}
  \item [a)] \code{!a \&\& (!b || !c)}
  \item [b)] \code{!a \&\& \ !b || !c}
\end{itemize}
